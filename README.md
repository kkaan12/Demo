1-Why can't we rely on CPU execution time measure algorithm efficieny?
Answer: Because of, There are many external factors.

2-How many operations does this code execute?
Code: int sum=0;
      sum=sum+5;
Answer: O(1)
3-Give give the final time complexity of the code.
a) Code: int sum= 0;
      for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
          sum+=i;
      }    
Answer: Time Complexity = O(n)
b) Code:
